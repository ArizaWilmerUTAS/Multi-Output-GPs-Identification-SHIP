# System indetification of Ship Dynamic System with Multi Output Gaussian Processes

This code is based in the work of Prof. Mauricio A. Alvarez and Prof. Neil D. Lawrence  [SheffieldML](usedhttps://github.com/SheffieldML/multigp) and the work of Prof. Dr. Ju≈° Kocijan. This is an inplmenetation of dynamic system indetification with multi-output Gaussian Processes.+

A Underactuated Ship model was used to generate data for system indetification. The system is a two input , four output system.
A NARX architecture was used for the Multioutput Gaussian Processes as for the comparative Neural Networks.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you have to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

# System indetification of Ship Dynamic System with Multi Output Gaussian Processes

This code is based in the work of Prof. Mauricio A. Alvarez and Prof. Neil D. Lawrence  [SheffieldML](usedhttps://github.com/SheffieldML/multigp) (some modification were made such that Gaussian Processes with dimension greater than 2 can be run) and the work of Prof. Dr. Ju≈° Kocijan. This is an inplementation of dynamic system indetification with multi-output Gaussian Processes.

A Underactuated Ship model was used to generate data for system indetification. The system is a two input , four output system.
A NARX architecture was used for the Multioutput Gaussian Processes as for the comparative Neural Networks.

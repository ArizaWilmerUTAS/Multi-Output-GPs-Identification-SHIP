# System indetification of Ship Dynamic System with Multi Output Gaussian Processes

This code is based in the work of Prof. Mauricio A. Alvarez and Prof. Neil D. Lawrence [SheffieldML](https://github.com/SheffieldML/multigp) (some modification were made such that Gaussian Processes with dimension greater than 2 can be run) and the [work](https://github.com/Dynamic-Systems-and-GP/GPdyn) of Prof. Dr. Ju≈° Kocijan. This is an implementation of dynamic system identification with multi-output Gaussian Processes. Both dependencies need to be installed before running the code. An Underactuated Ship model was used to generate data for system identification. The system is a two input , four output system. A NARX architecture was used for the Multi-output Gaussian Processes as for the comparative Neural Networks.
